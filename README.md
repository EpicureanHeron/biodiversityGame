Take 5 plants and plant them in your garden. 
1-Red Tomatoes 2- Orange Carrots/Yellow Corn 3- Green Lettuce 
4- Blueberries 5- Violet Eggplants

Students start by drawing in five of each color in any pattern or space.
Teacher rolls a 1d6 to determine which plant is infested. 6 infests any plant.

If a plant is infested any similar plant that is connected horizontal, vertical or diagonal is also infested. Any similar plants connected to those newly infested plants are also infested.

For example. If I have tomatoes in space 1 & 2 and I roll a one or a six, both crops become infested and die.

The goal is to see who has the most remaining crops at the end of 16 rounds.
